# Random C++ Code
<h2>Files that do random stuff. Maybe you can find a useful algorithm in here? ;)</h2><br>
<h3><a href="https://github.com/sntnmjones/Random_Cplusplus_Code/blob/master/isUnique.cpp">isUnique()</a></h3>
searches a string with getline() and finds if there are duplicate letters. If there are, it will cout "There is more than one ' ' in string. Otherwise, it will print,"There are no duplicates in this string."<br>
<h3><a href="https://github.com/sntnmjones/Random_Cplusplus_Code/blob/master/arePermutable.cpp">arePermutable()</a></h3>
Using cin to see if two strings are permutable. If so, cout "The strings are permutable." Else, "The strings are not permutable."<br>
